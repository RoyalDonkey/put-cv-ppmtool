> Piotr Kaszubski 148283

Solutions to tasks involving manipulation of PPM and PGM files.

All tasks are defined in the `tasks/` directory. Solutions to each task are
progressively developed and stored in git history. For example, solution to the
first task will be in a commit tagged `task1`.

## Building (Linux)

Firstly, run `git checkout task<N>` to navigate to the correct program. Then,
simply run:

    make

The executable file named `ppmtool` will be created.
